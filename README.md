# Operations-Research-Practical-Project-Excel-LPSolve-
Project Overview

This project applies core Operations Research and Operations Management techniques using Microsoft Excel and the LPSolve Add-in. It demonstrates the formulation, optimization, scheduling, and network analysis of managerial decision problems. The tasks completed reflect practical problem-solving skills in linear programming, project scheduling, and network-based decision analysis.

Key Components of the Project
1. Linear Programming Model (Excel + LPSolve)

Formulated a Linear Programming (LP) model to optimize resource allocation.

Defined objective function, decision variables, and system constraints.

Implemented and solved the model using Excel LPSolve, obtaining optimal values and sensitivity insights.

2. Project Scheduling Using Gantt Chart

Constructed a Gantt Chart to visualize project activities and timelines.

Identified task durations, dependencies, and project milestones.

Demonstrated the use of scheduling tools for planning and monitoring workflow.

3. Critical Path Method (CPM)

Performed CPM analysis to determine the longest path and minimum project duration.

Identified critical and non-critical activities and their slack times.

Highlighted activities requiring close monitoring to prevent project delays.

4. Network Analysis

Created a network diagram representing activity relationships and flow.

Analyzed forward and backward passes to compute earliest and latest start/finish times.

Used network logic to support decision-making in complex project environments.
